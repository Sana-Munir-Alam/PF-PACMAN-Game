ICANON: Canonical mode is responsible for line-buffered input, which means input is not sent to the program until the user presses Enter. By disabling this (~ICANON), the program can capture each character as it's typed, without waiting for Enter. ECHO: This flag causes input to be echoed back to the terminal (i.e., when you type, it shows up on the screen). By disabling this (~ECHO), characters typed by the user wonâ€™t be displayed on the terminal.
